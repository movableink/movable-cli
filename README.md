# studio-cli

Like `ember-cli`, but for studio apps.

## Usage

```sh
npm install studio-cli
studio new my-app
cd my-app
studio serve
```

This utility takes care of the following:
* Creating new apps from the default Studio blueprint (`studio new my-app`)
* Building apps (`studio build`)
* Serving those apps from a webserver (`studio serve`)
* Updating an app to the latest blueprint (`studio init`)
